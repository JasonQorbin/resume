            <h2>A little bit about me</h2>

            <p>
                In a nutshell, I'm an engineer (metallurgist to be precise) who needed change and went into the
                finance world. Now I'm rediscovering my love of all things technical, and now I'm making the transition
                into software development. So basically your typical millennial that can't make up his mind about what
                he wants to do.
            </p>
            <p> <img id="profile-pic" src="assets/images/profile(small).png" alt="Profile picture of Jason">
                I've been coding since the age of 15 back in high school where I took an extra class in computer
                science.
                There I learned the now functionally extinct programming language Turbo Pascal. After that all my
                programming
                knowledge came from stumbling upon problems in life and work that gave me an excuse to go and learn
                something
                new. So now I code in C++, Java, Python, Javascript, PHP, VBA, or whatever really. And all of that was
                self-taught
                through books and courses.
            </p>
            <p>
                Outside of code I like building and making things. <em>Maybe there's a reason why I became an engineer
                first...</em>
                So you'll find me doing DIY project, building things (computers and other things besides). And when I
                just
                need to vegetate on the couch for a bit you find me holding a controller and paying video games (the one
                true
                constant in my life since I was 4 years old)

                            <p>
                                In the world of corporate finance it's common to use mathematical models as tools to
                                develop a
                                view of the future state of a potential target/investee company. I was the lead
                                developer of
                                an Excel & VBA-based modelling tool that was used by around 350 people on a daily basis.
                            </p>
                        </div>
                        <h4 id="project1-panel2">Compliance alongside freedom</h4>
                        <div>
                            <p>
                                The users of the tool had previously created bespoke Excel models for every transaction.
                                However, the goal of the tool was to lock down the critical portions and more complex
                                calculations to reduce human-error and increase the reader's confidence in the voracity
                                of the final report.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Allowing the users to apply flexibility when the situation called for it required a
                                hybrid
                                solution. The critical portion of the tool remain permanently locked the model silently
                                switches between a locked state and an unlocked as the user moves between the sensitive
                                and
                                free-form part of the tool.
                            </p>
                        </div>
                        <h4 id="project1-panel3">Flexibility</h4>
                        <div>
                            <p>
                                Every business is different so the tool needed to have the ability to stretch and to
                                meet the
                                needs of the task at hand. The various submodules of the model were designed to be
                                modular and
                                tileable. Then macros were to built to reinitialise each submodule as needed.
                            </p>
                        </div>
                        <h4 id="project1-panel4">Alert System</h4>
                        <div>
                            <p>
                                Despite automating most of the calculations a user could still feed the model an
                                impossible
                                combination of data leaving the model in an inconsistent state. An <em>"Alert
                                System"</em> was
                                designed to give the user a birds-eye view of any issues they need to address.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Alerts are dynamically added and removed as the user adds extra modules to the model.
                            </p>
