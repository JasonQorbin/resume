        <h2>A little bit about me</h2>

        <p>
            In a nutshell, I'm an engineer (metallurgist to be precise) who needed change and went into the
            finance world. Now I'm rediscovering my love of all things technical, and now I'm making the transition
            into software development. So basically your typical millennial that can't make up his mind about what he
            wants to do.
        </p>
        <p>
            I've been coding since the age of 15 back in high school where I took an extra class in computer science.
            There I learned the now functionally extinct programming language Turbo Pascal. After that all my programming
            knowledge came from stumbling upon problems in life and work that gave me an excuse to go and learn something
            new. So now I code in C++, Java, Python, Javascript, PHP, VBA, or whatever really. And all of that was self-taught
            through books and courses.
        </p>
        <p>
            Outside of code I like building and making things. <em>Maybe there's a reason why I became an engineer first...</em>
            So you'll find me doing DIY project, building things (computers and other things besides). And when I just
            need to vegetate on the couch for a bit you find me holding a controller and paying video games (the one true
            constant in my life since I was 4 years old)

                    <h4>Overview</h4>
                    <p>
                        In the world of corporate finance it's common to use mathematical models as tools to develop a
                        view of the future state of a potential target/investee company. I was the lead developer of
                        an Excel & VBA-based modelling tool that was used by around 350 people on a daily basis.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Compliance alongside freedom</h4>
                    <div>
                        <p>
                            The users of the tool had previously created bespoke Excel models for every transaction.
                            However, the goal of the tool was to lock down the critical portions and more complex
                            calculations to reduce human-error and increase the reader's confidence in the voracity
                            of the final report.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Allowing the users to apply flexibility when the situation called for it required a hybrid
                            solution. The critical portion of the tool remain permanently locked the model silently
                            switches between a locked state and an unlocked as the user moves between the sensitive and
                            free-form part of the tool.
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <h4>Flexibility</h4>
                    <p>
                        Every business is different so the tool needed to have the ability to stretch and to meet the
                        needs of the task at hand. The various submodules of the model were designed to be modular and
                        tileable. Then macros were to built to reinitialise each submodule as needed.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Alert System</h4>
                    <div>
                    <p>
                        Despite automating most of the calculations a user could still feed the model an impossible
                        combination of data leaving the model in an inconsistent state. An <em>"Alert System"</em> was
                        designed to give the user a birds-eye view of any issues they need to address.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Alerts are dynamically added and removed as the user adds extra modules to the model.
                    </p>
